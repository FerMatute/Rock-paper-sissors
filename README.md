## Rock-paper-sissors

This is a program for the user to play rock paper sissors against the computer.

This program helped me create the logic for the Card-Jitsu game in the Repository "Proyecto Final TC1030".

## Considerations

This program is written in c++ and it is run in the console and it is compatible with every operating system.

The program will run until the user selects the characters N or n.

If the user selects a character diferent to Y or y the program will go to the main screen.

If the user selects a number diferent to 1, 2 or 3 when asked to select rock, paper or sissors the program will go to the main screen.
